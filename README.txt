The source code has been submitted and can also be found at, https://github.com/STisbi/Java.git, under the Distributed System project folder
The program was created using the Eclipse IDE in a Windows environment and can be opened as a project file in Eclipse.

The runnable submission contains 3 items: client.jar, server.jar, and a folder called serverFiles.

To run the program:
1) Download all the files found at https://github.com/STisbi/CSE_5306.git
2) Extract the contents of the .zip file.
3) Navigate to the folder with the extracted contents.
4) Extract the contents of serverFiles.zip
5) Open two command windows and change directories to this folder location of step 3.
6) In the first command window enter, "java -jar server.jar". This will start the server. It uses ports 2000-2019.
7) In the second command window enter, "java -jar client.jar". This will start the client.
8) In both command windows, output from the program will be shown. Additionally the .txt file within serverFiles can be opened and it's contents checked for the counter.

Note: Subsequent runs will append to the contents already in SharedFile.txt (within serverFiles). To see a fresh run with only that data, delete all contents within SharedFile.txt before performing steps 3 and 4.
